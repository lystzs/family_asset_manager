      # Frontend Build
      # Note: We use the production Dockerfile created in the repo, or we use a multi-stage one.
      # Since we are on GitHub Actions, we can just use the standard multi-stage Dockerfile in frontend/Dockerfile
      # But wait, our current frontend/Dockerfile is designed for the "Hybrid" approach (copying artifacts).
      # We need a STANDARD multi-stage Dockerfile for CI/CD that does the build INSIDE the container.
      # Let's check frontend/Dockerfile content first, but assuming we need to revert it to a standard build.
      # FOR NOW, let's assume we will update frontend/Dockerfile to be a standard standalone builder if needed,
      # OR we can do the "npm run build" step in the workflow and use the existing Dockerfile.
      # Better approach: Fix frontend/Dockerfile to be a complete multi-stage build so it works in standard CI.
